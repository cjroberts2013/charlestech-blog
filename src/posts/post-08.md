# React Meetup! 

So this evening I attended my first coding meetup in Austin. It was focused on Reactjs and covered a few different topics. 


The first topic covered apollo hooks and testing. This was a new topic for me but something a have been interested in learning. GraphQL is on my list of technologies to learn soon. 

The second topic covered serverside rendering with apollo. This was another very interesting talk. The speaker covered some of the use cases for it and showed a few examples along with displaying it at work on his company site. 

The third topic was over how to use React Poratals & Refs. These were both topics that I have not reached yet in my React learning so I was glad to get an in person introduction with examples. 

Overall, I had an amazing time at this meetup. There were so many interesting poeple there (300+), all ready to learn and discuss coding and react. This is a meetup group I plan to participate with for a long time. Next month's topic is GraphQL and I will definitely be there. So if you are in the Austin area and interested in software development, I high recommend checking it out.
