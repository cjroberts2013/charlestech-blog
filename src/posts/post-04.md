# Dealing with Issue

So today is just a post about my coding progress rather than the deep dives like in my past two post. Starting off this year, I gave myself the goal of working on my portfolio on every Tuesday and Thursday. I did this to help push myself towards actually completing it. Since the start of the year, I have actually made great progress on it. Well today, I decided to try an incorporate my portfolio into the this blog site. Easy enough I thought. It took quite a lot of tinkering since I am still pretty new to react and gatsby but I finally started to make progress. Things were looking great, I would run into a little problem and then find a solution for it. Once I finally got to a good stopping place, I decide to pull request it into my master branch and deploy it to my live site. What could go wrong? Everything was working on my localhost. Lo and behold, once my site update, I am greeted with 404 pages. What joy! I spent a few more hours trying to tract done my issue but I am still too new to gatsby to really wrap my head around it. Luckily, I was able to revert things back to how they were without too much trouble. I hope I will be able to find a work around in the next few days because I was feeling very excited about what I had achieved. Anyways, it just goes to show that so many unexpected road blocks can appear when dealing with code. You just have to try and keep your head up and keep pushing forward. 

Along with sharing my daily progress, I plan on sharing interesting and helpful articles that I find along the way. Thank you so much for checking out my post! If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me a message on twitter. I'd be glad to start up a conversation.
