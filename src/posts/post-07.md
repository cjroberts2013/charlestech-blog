# Todays Progress

Today I decided to take a day to review some old material as a refresher. I mainly focused on higher order functions, array methods, and then I just consumed some material about best practices along with other useful tips. It was a pretty relaxed day after going hard all week. 

Some very useful YouTube channels to check out are [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/traversymedia) and [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman). Both of these channels post amazing content and I can not recommend them enough.

Well that wraps up my short post for the day. Hopefully tomorrow will be a tutorial/deep dive type of blog.

Along with sharing my daily progress, I plan on sharing interesting and helpful articles that I find along the way. Thank you so much for checking out my post! If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me a message on twitter. I'd be glad to start up a conversation.
