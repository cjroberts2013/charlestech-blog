# Todays Progress

Today was another day filled with React. I started of by going through a few great articles by Code Artistry. I highly recommend you go check out their [TWITTER](https://twitter.com/codeartistryio). The articles i read were the [React Cheatsheet for 2020 (+ real-world examples)](https://codeartistry.io/the-react-2020-cheatsheet/) and [10 JavaScript Concepts You Need to Master React](https://codeartistry.io/10-javascript-concepts-you-need-to-master-react/). These articles were very well put together and I see them being very useful. After I got through the articles, I completed a few react challenges on [freecodecamp](https://freecodecamp.org). To end the day, I spent a few hours diving deeper into react components and react internals. Covering a lot of component lifecyle amongst other things. I am really enjoying react at this point and I am getting very excited for the future.

# Future Outlook

2020 will be the year that everything changes for me. I plan on applying for my first front-end developer job in the next few months. With that is coming a huge life change that I will get into more detail about later. I have felt stuck for the last few years for a number of unexpected life events but through coding, I have found something that I am passionate about and it has been life altering for me. All I can do now is keep working towards my goals and make my dream a reality. 

# My Motto
My motto for this year is to be someone today, that I will be proud of tomorrow. The only way we progress in life is by putting in the work required. Every hour of work I do today gets me that much closer to my goal. I want to be able to look back and be proud of all the effort I put forth towards acomplishing my goals. 

Well that's enough of my self motivating rant. Thank you so much for checking out my blog as always. I do truly appreciate it. If you have any questions for me or just want to chat, feel free to dm me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/cjrobertstech). I post there daily so I will be sure to respond promptly.
