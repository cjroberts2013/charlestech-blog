This is the first post of my tech blog. My goal with this blog is to talk about the technologies I am learning and the projects I am building. It will follow along with the #100DaysOfCode challenge that I have been doing on twitter. With this, I will be able to go into more detail of the things I am working on.

So to begin, today involved setting up this very blog. The last two days have been my first exposure in gatsby.js, which I have been really enjoying. So after learning the basics of gatsby and setting up a practice blog yesterday, I felt it was finally time to set up my actual public blog. There is still so much I need to learn and improve on this blog but this is a start and I can always improve it later. Through building this blog, I got the opportunity to practice react as well as get an introduction into GraphQL, a technology I have heard a lot about but didn't quite know what it was.

Along with sharing my daily progress, I plan on sharing interesting and helpful articles that I find along the way. Thank you so much for checking out my first post. If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me a message on twitter. I'd be glad to start up a conversation.

DISCLAIMER!!! I know I'm a terrible writer but it should get better over time, or not, who knows.
